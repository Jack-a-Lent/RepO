Replay Organiser

General use involves stashing all replays except for a particular replay/series being looked at.
Stashing replays moves them into the "Stash" subfolder and hides them from the in-game replays view.



The "Stash" and "Unstash" buttons affect the selected rows. 
Multiple rows can be selected by dragging, or by selecting while holding CTRL or SHIFT like in other applications.

Replays can be stashed/unstashed individually by clicking on the checkbox for the relevant rows.



Mouseover items for tooltips to show full texts. 

Hovering over the Goals column displays the goalscorers for that particular game, which may help for cases where no players are shown.
	E.g. when players leave the lobby before the match finishes.

Hovering over the File Name column displays the full path for the replay.



Uses rrrocket for parsing replay headers.
